# Generative Adversarial NetworkS using MNIST dataset
 The goal of this project is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of thousands of handwritten images. 

**MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology")** is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

**GANs** uses unsupervised process to discover and learn automatically from input data to generate new data from the original dataset.

### Tasks performed:
* Prepare the dataset for the model
* Develop Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model for classifying the handwritten digits
* Plot the change in accuracy per epochs
* Evaluate the model on the testing data
